I had bizarre tastes as a child. I turned my nose up at fish, but would greedily devour their eggs as Sindy-pink taramasalata. I loved that processed smoke-flavoured cheese that looked like a sausage, and my favourite restaurant treat, at the age of eight, was french onion soup. To be honest, this last probably had more to do with the monstrous garnish of melted Gruyère than the richly sweet and savoury broth beneath, but nevertheless, I enjoyed every last slurp.

My tastes are broader these days, and I haven't had any of the above in ages – mainly because, for reasons of sustainability, taste and fashion respectively, they're rarely on offer. Onion soup, however, is worth reviving: and quickly, because, beefy, boozy and pungent, it's very much a cold-weather dish. Make it now, before you lose your chance to really enjoy it for another year.
